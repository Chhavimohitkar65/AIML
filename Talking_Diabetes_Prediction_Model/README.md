<h3>3. Talking Diabetes Prediction using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Text-to-Speech</h3>
<p>Description: This project focuses on diabetes prediction using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.<br/> Similar to the heart disease project, we've added text-to-speech capabilities using the pyttsx3 library to make the results accessible via voice.</p>
