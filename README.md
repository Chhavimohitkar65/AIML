# Machine Learning Projects Repository 🚀

This GitHub repository contains a collection of machine-learning projects that demonstrate various techniques and algorithms for solving different real-world problems. Each project is designed to showcase a specific aspect of machine learning, from clustering and classification to incorporating text-to-speech functionality using the pyttsx3 library. 🎤

## Project List 🗂️

1. **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering** 📊  
   **Description:** This project explores customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer data is grouped into clusters based on similarities in their behavior, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies. 🎯  
   **Files:**  
   - `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis. 📓  
   - `customer_data.csv`: Sample customer data for analysis. 📂  

2. **Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression with Text-to-Speech** ❤️  
   **Description:** In this project, we build a heart disease prediction model using logistic regression. Additionally, we've incorporated a text-to-speech feature using the pyttsx3 library to provide voice-based results and recommendations. 🔊  
   **Files:**  
   - `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and voice integration. 📘  
   - `heart_disease_data.csv`: Heart disease dataset for training and testing. 📈  

3. **Talking Diabetes Prediction using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Text-to-Speech** 🍭  
   **Description:** This project focuses on diabetes prediction using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Similar to the heart disease project, we've added text-to-speech capabilities using the pyttsx3 library to make the results accessible via voice. 🗣️  
   **Files:**  
   - `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and voice integration. 📗  
   - `diabetes_data.csv`: Diabetes dataset for training and testing. 📊  

4. **Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest** 🍷  
   **Description:** This project tackles wine quality prediction using the Random Forest algorithm. It demonstrates a regression task, predicting wine quality scores based on various attributes. 📏  
   **Files:**  
   - `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis. 📖  
   - `wine_quality_data.csv`: Wine quality dataset for training and testing. 📊  

5. **Spam Mail Prediction using Logistic Regression** 📧  
   **Description:** In this project, we create a spam mail prediction model using logistic regression. The goal is to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content and features. 🚫  
   **Files:**  
   - `spam_mail_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis. 📘  
   - `spam_mail_data.csv`: Dataset containing email features for training and testing. 📨
