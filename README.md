Machine Learning Projects Repository
This GitHub repository contains a collection of machine-learning projects that demonstrate various techniques and algorithms for solving different real-world problems. Each project is designed to showcase a specific aspect of machine learning, from clustering and classification to incorporating text-to-speech functionality using the pyttsx3 library. Below is an overview of the projects included in this repository:

Project List-----
1. Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Description: This project explores customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
Customer data is grouped into clusters based on similarities in their behavior, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies.
Files:
      customer_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
      customer_data.csv: Sample customer data for analysis.

3. Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression with Text-to-Speech
Description: In this project, we build a heart disease prediction model using logistic regression. Additionally, we've incorporated a text-to-speech feature using the pyttsx3 library to provide voice-based results and recommendations.
Files:
     heart_disease_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and voice integration.
     heart_disease_data.csv: Heart disease dataset for training and testing.


4. Talking Diabetes Prediction using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Text-to-Speech
Description: This project focuses on diabetes prediction using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Similar to the heart disease project, we've added text-to-speech capabilities using the pyttsx3 library to make the results accessible via voice.
Files:
     diabetes_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and voice integration.
     diabetes_data.csv: Diabetes dataset for training and testing.


5. Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest
Description: This project tackles wine quality prediction using the Random Forest algorithm. It demonstrates a regression task, predicting wine quality scores based on various attributes.
Files:
    1. wine_quality_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
    2. wine_quality_data.csv: Wine quality dataset for training and testing.


6. Spam Mail Prediction using Logistic Regression
Description: In this project, we create a spam mail prediction model using logistic regression. The goal is to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content and features.
Files:
     spam_mail_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
     spam_mail_data.csv: Dataset containing email features for training and testing.
